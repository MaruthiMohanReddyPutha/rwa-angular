# Real World Angular Application
This application is a simple question and answer game based on a [blog](https://blog.realworldfullstack.io/real-world-angular-part-0-from-zero-to-cli-ng-a2ff646b90cc) at [Real World Full Stack](https://blog.realworldfullstack.io/).

It uses the following tech stack:
1. Angular 8 
2. TypeScript 3.5.2
3. RxJS ^6 (6 and above)

> It is a work in progress and updates would keep coming.
> Once the application is complete, an link to access the app would be posted here.

Happy Coding!
